It's time to start brainstorming about your breakable toys!

### Setup
```no-highlight
et get breakable-toy-deliverable-1
```
This directory will contain a file, `ideas.md`, in which you should answer the questions below.

Bonus points (not really) if you use manual line breaks within paragraphs in your response (instead of relying on soft wrapping), as this will make it easier for the EEs to read!

### Instructions
Please submit 1-3 ideas for your Breakable Toy, with a brief paragraph description for each one. When describing your idea, please consider the following questions:

- What is the very first feature you will start out with? (This means 1-2 models, and some simple functionality that you can deploy early.)
- Are there several models involved in your app, along with CRUD for each one? (There should be!)
- Does my idea align with my personal hobbies or interests? If not, it might be tough staying personally invested in building out this idea.
- Can my idea be implemented as a web application written in the frameworks we've learned? If not, that's a problem. Your Breakable Toy is required to be a web application, written in the fullstack framework you've learned here at Launch, with Unit and Feature Tests.
- Is one of your idea's main features interactive in a way that would be well-suited to utilizing React? You will be required to implement at least a portion of your front-end with the React.js library.
- Do you have some ideas for "fancy" features you can incorporate into your app if you have time? (e.g., external APIs, data visualization, cool JS or React features?)

#### "I really know what I want to make!"
If you are fairly certain about what you want to do for your Breakable Toy, you should only feel obligated to describe (in detail) that one idea. However, please do come up with a few other ideas in case your original idea is not feasible for some reason.

#### "I have some ideas, but I'm not certain about any of them"
Please submit several ideas so we can talk through the different options with you.

#### "I have no idea what I want to make, help!"
If you're feeling very stuck, don't spend too much time worrying about coming up with the "perfect idea" - just write down a couple things, even if you think none of your ideas are any good, and we can help you build them up from there!

### Submission
Please submit this in a markdown file (file ending in .md) using `et submit`.
